### Who am I?
  Hi, my name is Edgar Luiz de Lima, I am BSc. in Ecology and Environmental Analysis, MSc. in Natural Resources of the Cerrado (Environmental Sciences) and PhD student in Ecology. 
  I am currently working as a researcher in ecology, data analyst and scientific communicator.

### My research interests

  In the theoretical field, I work with spatial ecology. Specifically, I am interested in how organisms interact with the landscape and how it affects their movement. In  applied 
science, my research is focused on ecological indicators and the application of ecological theories on pest control in agroecosystems. The methods used by me include mathematical,
statistical models, systematic reviews as well as scientometrics and meta-analysis.
