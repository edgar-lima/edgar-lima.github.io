## Edgar Luiz de Lima, MSc.


### Who am I?
  Hi, my name is Edgar Luiz de Lima, I am BSc. in Ecology and Environmental Analysis, MSc. in Natural Resources of the Cerrado (Environmental Sciences) and PhD student in Ecology. 
I am currently working as a researcher in the Theory, Metacommunity and Landscape Ecology Laboratory at Universidade Federal de Goi√°s. I also develop work as data analyst and 
scientific communicator.
  
  
### My research interests

  In the theoretical field, I work with spatial ecology. Specifically, I am interested in how organisms interact with the landscape and how it affects their movement. In  applied 
science, my research is focused on ecological indicators and the application of ecological theories on pest control in agroecosystems. 


### Skills and tools

  The tools used by me to develop my work include mathematical and statistical models, systematic reviews as well as scientometrics and meta-analysis. In my theoretical research I 
use hybrid simulation models, which include agent-based models, cellular automata and machine learning. In my work I prefer to use free software such as Qgis, and to perform 
analysis and develop models and other solutions I use Python and R programming languages.
