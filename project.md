# Academic projects

   *Below are the research projects in which I am currently developing and collaborating.*
    <br />
## My projects

  **1) From individuals to communities: understanding the effects of habitat loss and fragmentation on movement and the dynamics of populations and communities.**
 <br />
  <div style="text-align: justify">The movement of individuals is an element of great importance for ecology, because it has a different contribution to each level of ecological 
  organization. While for individuals it is related to their survival, for populations it is related to demographic changes and for ecosystems it contributes to the entry and exit 
  of energy and nutrientes. The goal of this project is asses how habitats loss and fragmentation affects the indviduals movement, and what is its impact on individuals, 
  populations and communities. To answer these questions, I will use Individual-based models to simulate different scenarios of habitat loss and fragmentation, and to validate my 
  results, I will systematically review the movement ecology literature for birds and then test my hypotheses using a meta-analytical approach. </div>
     
  **2) Understanding the determining mechanisms of the landscape scale of effect.**
 <br />
  <div style="text-align: justify">Ecological studies rely on an appropriate choice for the spatial scale at which we measure environmental data to relate to ecological 
  processes. A common practice in landscape ecology is to measure response variables (e.g., species richness or abundance) in a focal patch and some possible explanatory variables 
  (e.g., environmental conditions, vegetation measures or landscape structure) at the higher spatial extents (landscape scale). However, what spatial extent (hereafter scale) 
  surrounding focal patch we should measure explanatory variables is not easy, this is because each species perceives the environment on a different scale. I aim to understand the 
  mechanisms that determine the scale of effect using using theoretical and empirical approaches. </div>
    
## Other projects

  **1) The importance of the Cerrado for agriculture: Remnants of natural vegetation as reservoirs of natural enemies of pests**
 <br />
  <div style="text-align: justify">The remnants of natural vegetation can offer several environmental services that optimize agricultural production, such as water control, 
  pollination and natural pest control. In the latter case, the remnants of natural vegetation favor the maintenance of natural enemies by offering various resources to these 
  organisms, which in turn, can migrate to surrounding agriculture and naturally regulate pest populations in crops. The objective of the present project is to test the role of 
  the Cerrado remnants in the natural pest control in soybean and rubber tree crops. In the present project, I am collaborating with the study group that evaluates the 
  environmental service of pest control at the landscape scale. </div>
  *This project is coordinated by the professor Rodrigo Damasco Daud and received funding from the Fundação de Amparo a Pesquisa de Goiás.*
